          <p><strong>Last Revised: January 9, 2026</strong></p>
          <p>This website, www.armorygrayscvle.com (the “Website”), is provided by ARMORY GRAYSCVLE (“ARMORY GRAYSCVLE,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).</p>
          <p>These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) govern all access to and use of the Website, including browsing, account creation, and the purchase of any products offered through the Website.</p>
          <p>By accessing or using the Website, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must discontinue use of the Website.</p>

          <p><strong>USE OF THE WEBSITE</strong><br>
          The Website may only be used for lawful purposes. Any use that interferes with the integrity, security, operation, or intended experience of the Website is prohibited.<br>
          We reserve the right, at our sole discretion and without prior notice, to restrict, suspend, or terminate access to the Website or any part of it, including user accounts, where necessary to protect the Website, the brand, or its users.</p>

          <p><strong>USER ACCOUNTS</strong><br>
          Certain features may require the creation of an account. You are responsible for all activity conducted through your account and for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials.<br>
          We are not responsible for loss, damage, or unauthorized access resulting from your failure to safeguard your account information.</p>

          <p><strong>PRODUCTS, PRODUCTION, AND AVAILABILITY</strong><br>
          All products offered on the Website are produced in limited quantities, and many items are made-to-order or customized.<br>
          Some collections or drops are fully limited and non-repeatable. Once production has begun or a drop has concluded, products may not be reproduced.<br>
          Availability is not guaranteed and may change without notice. The absence of a product does not imply restock or future availability.</p>

          <p><strong>PRICING AND PAYMENT</strong><br>
          All prices are listed in EUR (€) and are VAT included, unless stated otherwise.<br>
          Prices, product details, and availability may be modified at any time without notice. Orders are not accepted until payment has been received in full.<br>
          We reserve the right to correct pricing errors and to cancel orders placed at incorrect prices. If payment has been received for a canceled order, a refund will be issued for the amount paid.</p>

          <p><strong>PRODUCT REPRESENTATION</strong><br>
          We make reasonable efforts to display products accurately. However, due to handcrafted production, limited runs, and material variation:<br>
          Colors, textures, finishes, and measurements may vary<br>
          Measurements are approximate<br>
          Screen settings may affect visual representation<br>
          Such variations are inherent to the product and do not constitute defects.</p>

          <p><strong>SHIPPING AND DELIVERY</strong><br>
          We ship within the European Union and internationally.<br>
          Delivery times are estimates only and not guaranteed. Delays caused by carriers, customs authorities, or circumstances beyond our control are not our responsibility.<br>
          For international orders, customers are solely responsible for any customs duties, import taxes, or additional charges imposed by the destination country.<br>
          Risk of loss transfers to the customer once the order is handed to the carrier.</p>

          <p><strong>RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL AND RETURNS (EU COMPLIANCE)</strong><br>
          Under European Union consumer law, customers located in the EU have the right to withdraw from a distance purchase within 14 days of delivery, without providing a reason, unless an exception applies.<br>
          This right of withdrawal does not apply to:<br>
          Products made to order or customized to the customer<br>
          Products produced in limited, non-repeatable runs once production has begun<br>
          Where withdrawal rights apply, return conditions and procedures are detailed in our separate Returns Policy.<br>
          Due to the intentional and limited nature of our production, returns are discouraged to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>
          <p><strong>HOW TO EXERCISE WITHDRAWAL</strong><br>
          To exercise the 14-day withdrawal right (where eligible), email <a href="mailto:customercare@armorygrayscvle.com">customercare@armorygrayscvle.com</a> within 14 days of delivery, including your order number and intent to withdraw. Items must be returned unused, in original condition and packaging. Refunds are issued to the original payment method after inspection.</p>

          <p><strong>ACCESS CODES AND PRIVATE RELEASES</strong><br>
          Any access codes, promotional codes, or private release invitations are issued at our discretion. Such codes may not be shared, sold, transferred, or publicly distributed and may be revoked or expire at any time.<br>
          Possession of a code does not guarantee product availability.</p>

          <p><strong>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</strong><br>
          All content on the Website — including designs, text, images, graphics, logos, layout, and overall visual identity — is owned by ARMORY GRAYSCVLE or its licensors and is protected by applicable intellectual property laws.<br>
          No content may be copied, reproduced, modified, distributed, or used without prior written consent.</p>

          <p><strong>PROHIBITED CONDUCT</strong><br>
          You agree not to:<br>
          Access or attempt to access restricted areas of the Website<br>
          Use automated tools, bots, scrapers, or similar technologies<br>
          Interfere with the Website’s operation or security<br>
          Use the Website for unlawful, misleading, or abusive purposes<br>
          Unauthorized use may result in immediate termination of access and legal action.</p>

          <p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong><br>
          The Website and all content are provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE.”<br>
          We make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, regarding availability, accuracy, or suitability for any particular purpose.</p>

          <p><strong>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</strong><br>
          To the fullest extent permitted by law, ARMORY GRAYSCVLE shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from or related to the use of the Website or products.<br>
          Our total liability shall not exceed the amount paid by the customer for the product giving rise to the claim.<br>
          Nothing in these Terms limits or excludes consumer rights that cannot be excluded under applicable European Union law.</p>

          <p><strong>GOVERNING LAW</strong><br>
          These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Portugal, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Portugal, unless otherwise required by mandatory consumer protection law.</p>

          <p><strong>MODIFICATIONS</strong><br>
          We reserve the right to revise these Terms at any time. Updates take effect immediately upon publication. Continued use of the Website constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
